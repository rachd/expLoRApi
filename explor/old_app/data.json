Sacrifice your Last Breath minions for low drop Scuttles\n2a. Utilize Chronicler of Ruin + Mist's Call on CHAMPS. Although you can't play two Champs at once, you can kill one (with Chronicler) and rez it in the same round to actually get 2+ of the same champ out on the board. This can get pretty insane, especially if you get multiple Threshs/Vlads..\n2b. Use the same combo, but on Undyings and Keepers. Keep in mind though, they can't block.\n3. Use Fading Memories on the cards that kill allies! Butcher/Chronicler/Croc. If you want a quick reward though, feel free to use them on Keepers/Undyings.\n4. Kalista provides ANOTHER kill/rez combo with her level up. Pair with a big body, but prioritize Thresh.\n \nSubstitutes: \nIf you need more clear/aoe, feel free to sub in some Withering Wails or even a Ruination/Vegeance. I'd swap out Transfusion or a Croc or two.\n\nBiggest Weakness:\n1. Board clear can be a challenge. You basically just have to use the big bodies you create from combos to kill with blocking. Single target can also be pretty rough since you only have Black Spear.\n2. Having a large number of Keepers/Undyings on your bench. Although you'll have a threatening attack phase, you will be helpless on defense. I'd recommend keeping the amount of Undyings/Keepers below three. I wouldn't recommend summoning a Keeper if you can't sacrifice it by the next round.\n\n\n","owner":{"uid":"75308ccf-386f-4d40-92d2-99b4d49963fe","name":"foggsz","image":"https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/jtv_user_pictures/be36d8d9-48e7-4e18-b522-55f996733789-profile_image-300x300.png"},"cards":[{"id":"01SI047","set":"1","count":2,"region":"SI","title":"Fading Memories","description":"Pick a follower.

Avalanche is used to deal with aggro swarm type decks if any arise, if not the card is easily replaceable by additional copies of Flash Freeze, Harsh Winds or Winters Breath. To aid in the transition from the mid to late game, the deck plays 1 copy of Babbling Bjerg that draws out our heavy hitters such as Yone and Minah. While coming down later than Babbling Bjerg, Ritual of Renewal can bring us back to a healthy life total to make sure we reach that ever so important turn 10.\n\nIn the late game (turn 10 in the context of this deck), the deck plays the absolute powerhouse of a champion, Karma. Karma doubles our spells when cast, which is completely bonkers. A 2 mana Shatter becomes Frosbite an enemy and deal 4 damage to it and Ritual of Renewal (if we didn't need to cast it earlier) becomes heal 14 and draw 2 cards, which is back breaking amounts of advantage against decks that would look to win in the early phases of the game. A transformed Karma also means that our 2 main deck copies of Insight of Ages just turned into much better cards. While IoA is good on its own, when we attain Enlightenment they become true sources of value. Also in the late game we get Ashe, that hopefully is transformed at this point in the game. While it is possible to transform Ashe earlier in the game, I think it is in the best interest of the deck to hold onto Ashe until late game in order to use Crystal Arrow with her passive ability to end out games. A lot seems to happen late game for this deck, because it is also in the late game where our heavy hitters: Yone and Minah come down and clear up shop. Yone and Minah paired with Yasuo (transformed or untransformed) are a deadly combination.\n\nI do believe the deck is ready to meet and match most midrange and aggro match ups and the control mirror will be highly draw dependent on both sides. In the case that control becomes a meta staple perhaps playing 2 copies of Deny over the 2 copies of Avalanche could become a necessity. The decks removal suite between the power of Frostbite, Stun and Recall effects alongside Yasuo matches up well against a majority of creatures save perhaps Garen. Garen, in my opinion seems to be one of the stronger champions in the game with an extremely relevant ability and \"signature spell\". In the case that Garen becomes incredibly prevalent in the meta, Winters Breath will be our greatest tool and it would be recommended to increase the amount of Frostbite effects like Flash Freeze and Icevale Archer and the amount of copies of Winters Breath in order to counteract Garen's passive ability. If this does not counter or deal with Garen in a meaningful way, perhaps it would simply be better to swap from a Ionia/Freljord deck to a Ionia/Noxus deck using Noxian Guillotine and Culling Strike as premium removal options or even delving into a Ionia/Shadow Isles deck using Last Breath paired with spells like Vile Feast, Glimpse Beyond and Black Spear to justify utilising Last Breath cards along with late game spells like Vengeance to deal with ever so pesky Garen.","owner":{"uid":"ba90e8b6-47e4-49c3-92e2-19bebfaa7209","name":"thekingofwinter","image":"https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/user-default-pictures-uv/998f01ae-def8-11e9-b95c-784f43822e80-profile_image-300x300.png"},"cards":[{"id":"01FR030","set":"1","count":1,"region":"FR","title":"Brittle Steel","description":"<link=keyword.Frostbite><sprite name=Frostbite><style=Keyword>Frostbite</style></link> an enemy with 3 or less Health.","flavorText":"\"Chilly?

The cards you wanna try to combo with an Enlightened Karma (Save these cards in your hand unless they'll save you from a loss) are as follow:\n\n- Warmother's Call: Self explanatory, instead of summoning 1 unit at the start of every round, you'll summon 2 units cuz of Karma's passive. Making your board almost always filled with units.\n\n- Winter's Breath: With Karma, the initial cast will frostburn all enemies, while the second cast will kill all those frostburned enemies (Only counter is the enemy buffing up his units after the initial cast has been done.\n\nRitual of Renewal: You can go from 1 hp to 15 hp in an instant since you've got Karma's double cast.\n\nAvalanche: This is pretty much a suicide bomber card. It'll most probably kill your Karma (unless she's buffed up) but it'll help save you from those tight situations, dealing 4+4 dmg to EVERYTHING (Beware, this includes both yours, and the enemy's Nexus)\n\nTall Tales: If you already have a Yeti on the field with Karma, playing this card will grant you 2 Enraged Yetis, good for defending/attacking.\n\nThis deck needs a bit of practice and an understanding of its ins and outs, but once you get the hang of it, it'll help guide you to victory!\n\nTo all the fellow Summoners, I hope this build helps you become the Legend of Runeterra!","owner":{"uid":"928e1876-442f-428c-bc01-cc9f526aef4d","name":"Froz3nBlaze","image":"https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/jtv_user_pictures/froz3nblaze-profile_image-e9f2e66f14044f11-300x300.jpeg"},"cards":[{"id":"01FR014","set":"1","count":3,"region":"FR","title":"Yeti Yearling","description":"<link=keyword.Last Breath><sprite name=LastBreath><style=Keyword>Last Breath</style></link>: Shuffle 2 <link=card.create><style=AssociatedCard>Enraged Yeti</style></link> into our deck.","flavorText":"\"It was so tiny and peaceful!

The only exceptions being Hecarim and the Harrowing, which give you a secondary win condition for some counter matchups...... Followers... Archer, Stones, and Sentry are able to be used to block early damage. Be open to losing your stones, as they don't contribute to the combo... Islander and Chronicler are both combo activaters! (Though you can use a Chronicler for card draw on your archers if needed)...... Spells... Black Spear & Avalanche are used to clear wide boards, and Flash Freeze & Vengance stall bigger enemies.... Ruination is a last resort removal... Use Splinter Soul and Mist's Call as combo activators. Using spell mana efficiently can lead to early combos!..... The winnning combination for the deck is to get multiple Anivias on the board at once. The easiest combo is to summon an Anivia on turn 6, and use 3 spell mana to Splinter Soul a copy that will evolve at the end of the turn..... Typically only 2 Anivias should be needed, but the more the better....................

It offers control, a sufficient enough early game to transition / ramp into lategame, sustainability, versatility, comeback potential AND win more potential, tons of removal (some of which is interlinked/attached to bodies), insane draw/hand advantage, tempo, reach, hard hitting dudes, board wipes (for both masses of little bodies AKA tokens, as well as bigger, buffer threats), and the ability to close out the game with either a high quantity or quality of creatures. \nOnly weakness = ephemeral aggro with the Sunderer as top end, but even in such a scenario, Tryndamere provides some resilience, and you can still go pretty wide on the board with this deck due to the overall power level of the creatures. Generally speaking, a rule of thumb for card game design is that 'you shouldn't be able to build a deck that accomplishes everything or almost everything in excellent capacity'. If you're able to violate this rule, it's an indication that the game itself is either poorly designed, or that there are certain overpowered combinations unfixed within the meta. Well, this deck does indeed allow you to violate the aforementioned rule of thumb. However, this is a wonderful game, so I'll suggest that the indication lies in the latter camp. \n\nMake sure to mulligan differently depending on the faction you're matched against. For instance, against shadow isles, you'll value avalanche, but against something like ionia/piltover, you'll value frostbite effects and spot removal. Against other slow/control oriented decks, you want your ramp and draw effects--namely at least 2 of the greedy draw effects in the opening hand, in any combination, such as, ideally, x1 Bjerg and x1 Assessor. In control matchups, even against the revive deck from the Shadow Isles, you can still find yourself favoured to win, just because you get to run x3 Tryndamere as your finisher, and you have the added reach of Captain Farron combined with immense sources of card draw/advantage (if you hoard dead lategame draws, such as excess Shatters, Bjergs, Avalanches, Stones, etc., then in a control matchup you can convert Farron's entrance into an absurdly indefensible amount of reach damage to close things out.) Irrespective of factional particularity, you should always favour keeping Avarosan Sentry and Wyrding stone, but you should never keep more than 2 of either--and you should only ever keep 1 Wyrding stone unless you're certain you'll be playing against a deck that offers an underwhelming opener. Ashe is optimal to keep as a 1 of if the rest of your hand is at least passable, and a high priority card to fetch in midrange matchups. \n\nUltimately, I'd encourage you all to try out this fun deck if you enjoy thinking with a pay-off, synergistic ecstasy, and lastly, meta-abusing highly powerful/potent decks, as you ramp up into oblivion with your huge, eldritch creatures, and control the board prior & posterior.

Dawn and Dusk + Zed is often ez gg.\n-Navori Conspirator feels good to maintain tempo/chip/recall buffers\n-Bladetwirler is straight gas. High health already makes decent blocker, any handbuffs make it huge and potential finisher. Quickly gets out of control. Often demands immediate answer\n-Shadowshift just feels busted. \n\nPossible edits:\n- # of Jeweled Protectors. +3 often sets up for a huge often game winning swing and body is decent for blocking. At 5 mana maybe slow. Maybe 2x is better? \n- # of Dawn and Dusk. It is the main consistent win-con and can even be used for tempo if needed. At 6 mana and slow spell speed it might clog hand at 3x though\n- # of Inspiring Mentors. Might be a bit weak, maybe removal/draw better. Maybe 2x?\n- Navori Conspirator. Often great but almost always feels bad in top deck war. However if already top decking probably already gg. Consideration for cut\n- Ki Guardian. Mainly just in as cycle but the barrier has its uses. Consideration for cut\n-Stand United? Tech testing. Swapping units to protect from removal. Barrier to block damage while maintaining board. 6 mana kind of expensive and more defensive/protective card and doesn't necessarily advance win-con. Spell with burst speed helps expense and utility. \n-Progress Day? Tech idea post beta, needs testing. Deck just feels like it could use draw, spell mana makes it more realistic play. Cost reduction nice bonus.
